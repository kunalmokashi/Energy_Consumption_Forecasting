Energy consumption forecasting using daily energy consumption data and daily weather data.
Energy data is captured using smart meters at about 5000 households in London.
Weather data is captured using Dark Sky API.

Original source of the data - https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/smartmeter-energy-use-data-in-london-households
I obtained the dataset for this work from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/jeanmidev/smart-meters-in-london/metadata. (Thanks to the author - Jean. Michael D for the dataset).

Implemented SARIMAX, VAR, VARX (VAR with exogenous variables), LSTM.
Comparison based on RMSE, MAE and MAPE metrics.
